Hello, I am Joan, a passionate data analyst who is dedicated to exploring the world of data and discovering insights that can drive positive change. I have always been fascinated by the power of data to tell stories and reveal patterns. I loves nothing more than diving into complex data sets and using the skill in programming, statistics, and machine learning to extract meaningful insights. I hope to inspire others to embrace the power of data and use it to make a difference to your career.

When I aren't busy exploring the world of data science, I enjjoy spending my free time pursuing other passions. I love Baking! I loves nothing more than experimenting with new recipes and sharing my creations with friends and family. I also enjoy reading productivity books, which I find inspiring and motivating. I believes that by learning from the experiences of others and adopting new strategies for managing time and staying focused, I can be more effective in all aspects of my life. Whether I am in the kitchen or curies up with a good book, I always seeking new ways to challenge myself and grow as a person.
